## PART E
  Generating Vault Key: When a user starts a game, a 6 digit random key is generated, where the key rather than containing numbers has specifications for what type of number must be in each spot. Each digit can be a number between 0 and 9 inclusive. There is not one correct solution. Rather, each spot will indicate its relation to the previous spot (e.g. Spot 2 must be < Spot 1).\
  Hints: \
    - Each user gets up to 3 hints.\
    - When a user requests a hint, the current guesses for each digit will be evaluated\
    - If the digit is incorrect, the box with that digit will turn red; the number guessed will then be evaluated against the correct digit\
    - If the digit is correct, box with that digit will turn green
## PART F
  This game is simple to learn, yet still challenging enough to be consistently engaging.\
  Since there are no levels nor a consistent answer, the game avoids becoming redundant. \
  Educational: While it may seem a generally simple guessing game of chance, younger kids can use this to reinforce basic concepts like greater/less than that theyâ€™d encounter in a math class.
