  Generating Vault Key: When a user starts a game, a 6 digit random key is generated. Each digit can be a number between 0 and 9 inclusive. The user cannot see this key, as they are supposed to guess it.\
  Hints: \
    - Each user gets up to 3 hints.\
    - When a user requests a hint, the current guesses for each digit will be evaluated\
    - If the digit is incorrect, the box with that digit will turn red; the number guessed will then be evaluated against the correct digit\
    - Whether the guess is less or greater than the correct number will be shown for all incorrect guesses\
    - If the digit is correct, box with that digit will turn green
## PART F
  This game is simple to learn, yet still challenging enough to be consistently engaging.\
  Since there are no levels nor a consistent answer, the game avoids becoming redundant. \
  Educational: While it may seem a generally simple guessing game of chance, younger kids can use this to reinforce basic concepts like greater/less than that theyâ€™d encounter in a math class.
